## Organization of notebooks

### MovieLens analysis (Sections 2 and 3 of the paper)
- `movielens-preprocess.ipynb`: Primarily used to annotate movies in the rating data to their stereotypical gender, and format the ratings dataset so that it can be easily run with Wan et al.'s code.
- `movielens-exploratory.ipynb`: Contains the majority of the analysis and results in Section 2 
- `movielens-statistical-Wan_et_al.ipynb`: Following Wan et al.'s statistical analysis. The only result we include in the paper is the ANOVA statistical test.
- `movielens-MF.ipynb`: Analysis of matrix factorization predictions after running Wan et al.'s code for standard MF and their fairness-aware framework on MovieLens 1M.
